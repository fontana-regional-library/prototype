# Tawny Owl

> Non-library: "Tawny Owl" - they're evolving and so are we! (and it's cuter than worms & germs) - Amy West

**Tawny Owl** is our prototype for our website. It's where we experiment and iterate, where we figure out what's next, what's useful, what works for patrons, and what works for us.
