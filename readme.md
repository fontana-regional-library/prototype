# Tawny Owl
>  Non-library: "Tawny Owl" - they're evolving and so are we!
 (and it's cuter than worms & germs) - Amy West
 
 **Tawny Owl** is our prototype for our website. It's where we experiment
 and iterate, where we figure out what's next, what's useful, what works
 for patrons, and what works for us.
