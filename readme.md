# Tawny Owl

> Non-library: "Tawny Owl" - they're evolving and so are we! (and it's cuter than worms & germs) - Amy West

**Tawny Owl** is our prototype for our website. It's where we experiment and iterate, where we figure out what's next, what's useful, what works for patrons, and what works for us.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

We can and do load-up a work-in-progress version of this web app to github pages,
which is sourced out of the `/docs` directory on the `master` branch. To spin this up,
just
```
npm run publish
```
which will build the app, make a copy of the build in the `/docs` folder, and then do 
some magic with leading slashes so Github knows where to find its files. Give it a try.
